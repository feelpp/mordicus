1) **DEPENDENCIES**

    PYTHON OPEN-SOURCE DEPENDENCIES
    BasicTools (and its dependencies)


2) **DOCUMENTATION**

    Documentation is generated by sphinx by executing the following
    in the doc folder

	make html


3) **TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE**

    Every module must have a function called "CheckIntegrity" that takes no
    argument and returns the string "ok" if and only if the test was successful.

    The __init__.py must have a variable named __all__ listing all submodules
    so that the test infrastructure works as intended.

    The testing and coverage are done using BasicTools testing infrastructure
    with respectively:

    Testing:
	python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e core -f
    python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e modules -f

    Coverage:
	python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e core -cl
    python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e modules -cl
    	
    	
4) **EXAMPLES**

    Examples are available in the folder examples/
    They can all be executed by the command "python3 genericROMscript.py"
