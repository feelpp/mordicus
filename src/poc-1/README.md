1) **DEPENDENCIES**

    python minversion  3.6
    Dependencies :
      - pytest, pytest-cov
      - BasicTools, and its dependencies : numpy scipy scikit-sparse matplotlib vtk sympy pyamg h5py pyparsing Cython sphinx pytest pytest-cov setuptools

    recommandation: create a dedictated conda environment from the channel conda-forge


2) **DOCUMENTATION**

    Documentation is generated by sphinx by executing the following
    in the doc folder

	make html


3) **TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE**

    Every module must have a function called "CheckIntegrity" that takes no
    argument and returns the string "ok" if and only if the test was successful.

    The __init__.py must have a variable named __all__ listing all submodules
    so that the test infrastructure works as intended.

    The testing and coverage can be done using BasicTools testing infrastructure
    with respectively:

    Testing:
	python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e core -f
	python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e modules -f

    Coverage:
	python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e core -cl
	python3 BasicTools/Helpers/Tests.py -e modules -cl


    or using pytest:
	go to the src/poc-1/src/ folder and type
	pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html:../../coverage_report
	a html report is generated in the src/coverage_report folder
    	
    	
4) **EXAMPLES**

    Examples are available in the folder examples/
    They can all be executed by the command "python3 genericROMscript.py"
