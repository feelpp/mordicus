Basic algorithms provide helpfull functionalities on the datamodel:

    - Interpolation: time interpolation for snapshots, reducedSnapshots, and loadings data

    - ScikitLearnRegressor: automatization of gridsearchCV for optimizing hyperparameters

    - SVD: classical truncated singluar value decomposition for lower symmetrical matrices
